## Included Files


## Prerequisites

1. R (tested on R-3.4.2)
2. RStudio IDE (tested on )
3. The following R packages:
 * dplyr
 * rmarkdown and knitr are included with RStudio and do not need to be installed.

The above prerequisites will alow you to launch and test the application. In order to publish to the web, you need a few more pieces. There are many ways to acheive a similar result, here the tools I used.

1. Github Account
2. Github Pages

## Steps to Launch

1. Open .Rproj file in RStudio.
2. Click something to launch in RStudio viewer pane.

## Lessons Learned

1. Github Pages takes time to update. In some cases, more than 30 minutes after committing and pushing changes to github. This was incredibly confusing for someone still learning git. I thought that my changes were not being logged.
