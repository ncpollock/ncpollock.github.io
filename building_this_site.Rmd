## Scope
Learn to buid a website like this one using R, RStudio, and GitHub.

## Introduction and Prerequisites
There are many ways to build and publish a website using R. Here, I chronicle only one method using pre-built functionality in RStudio. Here are some things you'll need before we get started:

1. R (I used version R-3.4.2)
2. RStudio IDE (I used version 1.1.383)
3. Familiarity with rmarkdown and knitr

The above prerequisites will allow you to launch and test the application. In order to publish to the web, you need a few more pieces.

1. Github Account
2. Github Pages (a GitHub Repo configured in a specific way)

## Step 1: Setup in RStudio

Open RStudio and create an R Project (File -> New Project). Then create a new R Script (File -> New File -> R Script), copy and paste the code below into it, and save it within your R Project directory with the name _site.yml.

```{r example_site_yml, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
name: "awesome_site"  
navbar:  
  title: "Awesome Site!"  
  type: default  
  left:  
    - text: "Home"
      icon: fa-home
      href: index.html
    - text: "About"
      icon: fa-info
      href: about_me.html
    - text: "Blog"
      icon: fa-street-view
      href: blog.html
  right:
    - text: "Need Help"
      icon: fa-question
      href: https://google.com
output:
  html_document:
    df_print: kable
output_dir: "."
```

The _site.yml file is your website configuration file, it will define some the elements that persist across your site such as the navigation bar, headers or footers, or the global theme. For the most part you have a lot of customization here. However, one piece that is extremely important not to change is the `output_dir: "."` line. This tells RStudio to keep important files in the root directory of the R Project folder which is how Github Pages will expect it to be.

You can read more about [R Markdown Websites and _site.yml here.](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html)

## Step 2: Build Webpages from Rmarkdown

There's one more piece we need for RStudio to completely handle our new website, a main/landing page! Create a new R Markdown file (File -> New File -> R Markdown, choose HTML and give it a title like "Welcome!"). Make some simple changes to the R Markdown template RStudio provides so you know that the site you render is truly yours. For example, write yourself a congratulatory message as the first paragraph. Now save this file as index.Rmd.

Confirm that your _site.yml and your index.Rmd files exist in your R Project folder. Close and reopen RStudio. Now you should see a new tab near the Environment pane called "Build". Navigate to that tab and click "Build Website". The Build Website button knits every .Rmd file in your R Project root directory. Voila! Your site should open in the viewer pane or in a new window.

Now, create more pages (e.g., about_me.Rmd, blog.Rmd, any page you like!).

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/build_window.JPG") `

## Step 3: Setup GitHub

Create a GitHub Repo configured for GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

## Step 4: Publish

Before sending all of your files to your GitHub repo, you'll need an empty file titled .nojekyll within your R Project directory. When this file is pushed or uploaded to your GitHub repo, it tells GitHub not to publish your website using Jekyll.

To get your website files onto GitHub, you can either use Git if you already know how, [learn Git](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), or manually upload all of your files to your Github repo.

## Step 5: Customize and New Content

See the optional lines you can add into your _site.yml file to further upgrade or customize your site!

```{r better_yml, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
output:
  html_document:
    theme: flatly
    css: my_style.css
    include:
      in_header: GA_Script.html
```

**theme: flatly** Choose a theme  
In your _site.yml file you can specify a global theme to be applied. Simply include theme: theme_name under html_output. You can also style your site with CSS or Cascading Style Sheets. 

**css: my_style.css** Custom CSS  
To completely customize your theme or individual pages, you can add CSS. For example, add the following code immediately following your yaml header in any of your .rmd files. Make sure it's outside of any code chunks. A better way to apply global styles to your entire site is to create a my_style.css [^1] file with your css code, and tell your _site.yml file to include it for html output.

[^1]: Or name it whatever you like, as long as it's a .css file and you specify the correct name in your _site.yml file.

```{r css, eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
<style>
body{
  font-family: Helvetica;
  font-size: 18pt;
  background-color:orange;
}
</style>
```

**in_header: GA_Script.html** Google Analytics  
To track and understand who visits your website, how often, and what they do there. [You can learn about how to do this via the Google support documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en).
